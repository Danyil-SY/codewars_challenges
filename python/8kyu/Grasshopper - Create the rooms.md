# Grasshopper - Create the rooms

---

### Escape the room

You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

### Solution

```py
rooms = {
    'room1': {'name': '',
        'description': '',
        'completed': 0},
    'room2':{'name': '',
        'description': '',
        'completed': 0},
    'room3': {'name': '',
        'description': '',
        'completed': 0},
}
```
