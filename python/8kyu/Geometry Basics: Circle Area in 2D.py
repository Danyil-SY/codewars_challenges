# This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

# Write the function circleArea/CircleArea which takes in a Circle object and calculates the area of that circle.
# The Circle class can be seen below:

# class Circle:
#     def __init__(self, center, radius):
#         self.center = center
#         self.radius = radius
# And the Point class can be seen below:

# class Point:
#     def __init__(self, x, y):
#         self.x = x
#         self.y = y

import math

def circle_area(circle):
    return math.pi * (circle.radius ** 2)
